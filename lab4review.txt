SQL statements are readable
Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
Mostly correct SQL statements



2. Get the ids of products ordered through any agent who takes at least one
order from a customer in Dallas, sorted by pid from highest to lowest. (This is
not the same as asking for ids of products ordered by customers in Dallas.)

Incorrect output
- The ORDER BY is in the wrong order


3. Get the ids and names of customers who did not place an order through agent
a01.

Incorrect output
- You are missing names


4. Get the ids of customers who ordered both product p01 and p07.

Incorrect output
- You are not including 'p07'
Incorrect query
- You missed a semicolon


6. Get the name, discounts, and city for all customers who place orders through
agents in London or New York.

Incorrect output
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query.
  Missing city!


8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- No submission here.


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure you have semicolons at the end of each of your queries. 
  Your query produced an error!

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
