Correct output for all queries
Correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  select * from products where city not in ('Dallas','Duluth') and priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city NOT IN ('Dallas', 'Duluth')
    AND priceUSD >= 1;


In general: 

- Very good!

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
